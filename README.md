## Steps for Single Computer Approach:
- [ ] Pick an approach
- [ ] Pick a language
- [ ] Create python script that successfully sends a request to "fake" server/ip (localhost)
- [ ] Send multiple requests to local (enough to cause an impact maybe?)
- [ ] Add threads into the mix
- [ ] Successfully send a request to a real server/ip
- [ ] Send multiple request to real ip/server
- [ ] Test and record results


## Potential improvements
- Using a VPN (research how to hide ip)
- Not only use a single computer to produce requests
- Convert to more efficient language
