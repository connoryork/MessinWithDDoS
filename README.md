## Steps for Single Computer Approach:
- [x] *Pick an approach* - Single computer
- [x] *Pick a language* - Python, on windows. If this doesn't work, we will switch to C/C++ on linux
- [x] *Create python script that successfully sends a request to "fake" server/ip (localhost)*
- [x] *Send multiple requests to local (enough to cause an impact maybe?)*
- [ ] *Convert IP address to url using DNS converter*
- [ ] *Add threads into the mix*
- [ ] *Successfully send a request to a real server/ip*
- [ ] *Send multiple request to real ip/server*
- [ ] *Test and record results*


## Potential improvements
- Using a VPN (research how to hide ip)
- Not only use a single computer to produce requests
- Convert to more efficient language
