# MessinWithDDoS
Educational learning experience with forks and pinging servers



## Steps for Single Computer Approach:
1. Create python script that successfully sends a request to "fake" server/ip (localhost)
2. Send multiple requests to local (enough to cause an impact maybe?)
3. Successfully send a request to a real server/ip
4. Send multiple request to real ip/server


## Potential improvements
- Using a VPN (research how to hide ip)
- Not only use a single computer to produce requests
